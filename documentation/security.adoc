== Database

Minimalist data collection ensures a minimal attack surface of our database. We only collect the information we need to provide the service to our users. See link:gdpr-complience.adoc[our GDPR complience document] to know more about data collection and processing.

== Password hashing

The password given by the user are hashed before beeing stored in the database.
The hash algorithm used is `sha256` implemented by the `hashlib` python3 library.
This algorithm was choosen because `md5footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Security[md5 security issues]]` and `sha1footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Attacks[sha1 security issues]]` are "cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use".
